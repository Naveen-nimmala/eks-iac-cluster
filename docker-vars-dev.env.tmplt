# HOWTO:
# ------
# Step 0: DO NOT MODIFY this template file in any way
# Step 1: Copy-Paste this file into a new file the same path as this template file
# Step 2: Remove the .tmplt extension from the newly copy-pasted file's name
# - so that the filename ends with ".env"
# Step 3: Save an executor SA JSON key file into the '/tmp' folder at the root of this repository
# - the '/tmp' folder is gitignored - so it's safe to keep credential files in it
# Step 4: Inside the newly copy-pasted .env file, fill in the values for the environment variables below.

ENV="dev"
TF_EXECUTOR_SA_KEY_PATH="../../tmp/dev_executor_sa_key.json" # this is a relative path
TF_OWNER_SA_EMAIL="dev_tf_owner_sa@email.com"

# Step 5: Repeat all the above for different environments
